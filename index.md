# Changing Landscape of Energy
## A glance at the how energy consumption and production has changed over the last 2 decades and its impact
### by Aparna Shree Sivanandam, Daanish Mohammed, Sahithi Mattapalli and Kartik Sharma

In today's age of alarming levels of climate change, rising surface temperatures, immense pollution, melting ice caps, holes in the ozone layer, there is increasing concern and discussion around saving our planet. It is a well known fact that changes observed in Earth’s climate since the mid-20th century are driven by human activities, particularly fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth’s atmosphere, raising Earth’s average surface temperature. While there are efforts being taken to switch to greener alternatives, where exactly are we in this shift? what are the primary sources of fuel that meet majority of our needs even today? How is our current levels of energy consumption contributing towards pushing the planet to the brink in terms of increasing green hose gas emissions? How are different countries working towards shifting to renewable alternatives? What are some factors that are pushing us towards increased fuel consumption?

These are all important questions and they help us garner a clearer picture of where we are and how much more we have to work towards attaining a more sustainable planet.

### The Data
We have used data primarily from the [World Energy Consumption Dataset](https://ourworldindata.org/energy) and [GHG Emission Dataset World Energy Consumption](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-product/greenhouse-gas-emissions-from-energy-highlights) to analyse the energy consumption trends from different sources, how other social factors such as GDP and population have imapcted this trend, and how energy consmuption has impacted green house gas (GHG) emissions. 

### Energy Consumption over the years

Take a look at this barchart showing how annual consumption of energy all over the world from 1990 to 2020, the last two decades. While we might feel positive that renweable energy sources are put to use and the rates of their consumption have been steadily increasing in time, it is frightening to note that renewable energy still meets less than 50% of our demand. We still thrive over non renewable sources of energy to meet majority of our energy and fuel demands. Use of fossil fuels like coal and oil is severely damaging our environment. On a slighlty brighter side, the consumption of fossil fuels dropped by 0.8% in 2020. This could be a result of the global pandemic and people forced to quarantine and stay home bringing travel to a standstill reducing fuel usage.

### The Data

In the rock climbing community, difficulty ratings for climbing routes range from 5.0 to 5.15, with +/- or a/b/c/d modifiers to further expand the scale. For simplicity, we’ve divided these into the following four groups:

5.10a and below: **Beginner**

5.10a/b through 5.10d: **Intermediate**

5.11a-d: **Advanced**

5.12a and above: **Elite**

To learn more about what the original ratings mean, you can visit [this page](https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/climbing-bouldering-rating.html).

As you can see in the pie chart above, each category contains a roughly equal number of routes.

### Keywords of Potential Interest

Route descriptions entered into MountainProject are packed with rock climbing slang that, while providing great opportunities for analysis, can be difficult for a newcomer to understand. Some words will be explained along the way, and we’ve included a brief glossary at the end for the rest. 

After filtering out filler words, such as prepositions, articles, etc. from the route descriptions, we identified 88 words as potentially interesting and useful for our analysis. Some common words, like "angle," were excluded because they could have a wide range of meanings depending on context.

<iframe seamless frameborder="0" src="https://public.tableau.com/shared/QKP4DRBBW?:language=en-US&embed=yes&:display_count=yes&:showVizHome=no" width = '850' height = '550' scrolling='yes' ></iframe>

The word cloud above shows how many times each word appears in the dataset. The size of each word represents how common a given word is the overall dataset, while the color of the word represents how common it is in the selected category.


### Keywords Common Between Categories

<iframe seamless frameborder="0" src="https://public.tableau.com/views/climbinganalysis2/Dashboard3?:language=en-US&embed=yes&:display_count=yes&:showVizHome=no" width = '850' height = '650' scrolling='yes' ></iframe>    

In the above view, if you sort the words by the "Beginner" difficulty category, you will see the words sorted by their frequency in easier routes. You can see how certain keywords pertain to different difficulties.
For example, the word "slab" is more common with beginner routes, and becomes less common as the difficulty increases. This is due to the fact
that "slab" references a route that is fairly straightforward and vertical, which helps to make a route easier.

On the other hand, a route with more "roof" elements is increasingly more common in harder routes,
because a roof is more horizontal, which requires a climber to be more parallel to the ground when they climb this section. Climbing a roof requires a great deal of effort, which is why it
seems to be associated with more challenging routes.


### Climbing Skills Required

There are 3 main skill types involved in climbing a route. **Endurance** is necessary to sustain long periods of effort along a route, especially routes that are longer from start to finish. **Technical** ability refers to a climber's
knowledge and practice of moving their body in the ideal way for the specific rock formation surrounding them. **Power** is generally associated with the climber's maximum strength, which becomes important
in performing dynamic, fast changes in body position on a rock face.

Twenty-four of our selected keywords have a clear association to one or more climbing styles. We used these words to calculate a Technical Score, Power Score, and Endurance score for each route. Representing these scores as a percent of the total score for a route, we can visualize the style trends in the ternary plots below. The score quality represents the total score for a route (range 2.1 - 103.4), with higher scores indicating that a route description includes words with stronger association to style such as the literal style word.

Click the buttons along the bottom to view how the climbing requirements change as the difficulty increases.
In the beginner routes, a climber must have a basic level of endurance, technical ability, and power. The plot
is relatively sparse, meaning that many of the beginner routes do not utilize these skills enough to warrant inclusion in the description.

As the difficulty increases, so do the number of routes that use description words associated with one or more of these styles. Challenging routes require dedication to hone these skills, and as you can see in the Elite category, all three skills are heavily represented throughout the plot. Perhaps more notable, however, is the concentration of routes in the center. While there are very few balanced routes at the beginner level, more difficult routes are most likely to require a combinationn of two or even all three skills.


### Physical Features of Routes
#### Types of Hold

A **hold** is a rock climbing term for the places on the rock surface that are shaped in a way for a climber to attach themselves to the route
and propel themselves higher.

A **crimp** is a type of hold that consists of a small edge that can support the tips of a climber's fingers.
**Jugs** are large, deep, concave holds that are relatively easy to grab with one or both hands.
A **knob or pinch** hold can be "pinched" between a climber's fingers and thumb, and requires intense strength to grasp.
**Pockets** are holes within a wall that a climber can use to insert their hand or fingers.
**Slopers** are large, round holds that can be difficult to grip and do not have sharply defined edges.

In the above view, you can see how the hold types vary by difficulty level. 
Click on the buttons to the right to change which hold type is lined up along the x axis.

Crimps are a type of hold that is rather difficult to grasp, so
crimps become more common as the difficulty increases. 

Jugs are the opposite: since they are easy to grab,
jugs are common among easier routes and are less present in challenging routes. Easy routes are correlated with the presence of jugs.

Interestingly, knob and pinch holds make up a greater proportion in the beginner routes than the intermediate and advanced routes. As visible in the "Keywords Separated By Category" bar graph shown earlier in this page,
knob holds specifically are more common with easier routes, while pinch holds are more common with harder routes. Though they are a very similar type of hold which is why we grouped them together,
the relative roundness of knob holds compared to pinch holds potentially makes them easier to grasp and therefore more likely to make a route easier. 

The elite routes predictably have the highest percentage of slopers, which makes sense due to slopers' tendency to be incredibly difficult to grasp. Based on this data, slopers seem to make routes harder.

#### Types of rock shape

We have identified 5 different route shapes common among the routes in our dataset. In addition to slab and roof elements, common route shapes include arete, chimney, and dihedral features.

![](rocks.png)

**Overhang** can be considered a less extreme version of a roof, where it is a rock face angled towards the ground, but not as parallel to the ground as a roof would be.
**Arete** routes contain an edge or outer corner along its side, while a **chimney** refers to a section of rock with at least 2 parallel faces on which a climber can place their hands and feet to leverage the opposing forces.
**Dihedral** routes involve two intersecting faces of rock that form an angle. It can be thought of as an inside corner.

<iframe seamless frameborder="0" src="https://public.tableau.com/views/rockshape_stackedbar/RockShape?:language=en-US&embed=yes&:display_count=yes&:showVizHome=no" width = '850' height = '600' scrolling='yes' ></iframe> 

This view highlights the different rock features that are present in the difficulty categories. We knew from the keywords visualization that the slab shape of a route is more common with easier routes and that roof elements are more common with difficult routes,
but here we can see the overall proportions of routes in each category that contain such features. 

A whopping 53.3% of elite routes contain roof or overhang elements, compared to only 27.35% of beginner routes. On the flipside, only 19.65% of elite routes are slab-shaped, compared to beginner routes' 41.68%.

From this view, we can determine that it is likely that slab and chimney elements of a route help to make it easier to climb, while roof & overhang make it more difficult.

As for dihedral and arete features, their presence seems to be evenly distributed among the difficulty categories. Based on that observation, it is likely that these features vary in difficulty and do not necessarily 
contribute to causing a route to be easier or harder.

### RouteFinder: An Interactive Map

Revisiting the initial map of all routes, it is now much more interactive. Using what we have learned so far about what makes a route easier or harder, you can filter the map based on hold types and rock shape, as well as by pure difficulty ratings of course. Also, you'll notice that a small jitter has been applied for routes in the same location, so all should be visible if you zoom in.

<iframe seamless frameborder="0" src="https://public.tableau.com/views/map_routes/Dashboard2?:language=en-US&embed=yes&:display_count=yes&:showVizHome=no" width = '850' height = '550' scrolling='yes' ></iframe>

Ultimately, each climber is unique and likely has or will develop their own personal preferences regarding what they'd like to climb. We hope that this final map view will enable prospective outdoor climbers to review potential spots with more information than just the difficulty level and choose the right sport climbing route for themselves.
